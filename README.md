## 📝 My Journey into Programming  

It all started with a personal need: a **fishing knots app** for Windows Phone.  
Armed with online courses like *“C# for Absolute Beginners”*, I created **Fishing Knots+**.  

That small app sparked a career in software development, leading to professional roles and open-source contributions.
